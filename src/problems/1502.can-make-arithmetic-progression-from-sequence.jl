# 
# Given an array of numbers `arr`. A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic
# progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the
# same.
# 
# Return `true` if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic
# progression, otherwise, return `false`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: arr = [3,5,1]
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: arr = [1,2,4]
#     Output: false
#     Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
#   * `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
#
