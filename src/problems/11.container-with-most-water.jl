# 
# Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a
# point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two
# endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which,
# together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains
# the most water.
# 
# **Notice**  that you may not slant the container.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**

# 
#     
#     
#     Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
#     Output: 49
#     Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: height = [1,1]
#     Output: 1
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
#     Output: 16
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: height = [1,2,1]
#     Output: 2
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `n = height.length`
#   * `2 <= n <= 3 * 104`
#   * `0 <= height[i] <= 3 * 104`
#
