# 
# An `image` is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer
# representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).
# 
# Given a coordinate `(sr, sc)` representing the starting pixel (row and column)
# of the flood fill, and a pixel value `newColor`, "flood fill" the image.
# 
# To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels
# connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the
# starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels
# (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color
# of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.
# 
# At the end, return the modified image.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 
#     image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
#     sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
#     Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
#     Explanation: 
#     From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
#     by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
#     Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
#     to the starting pixel.
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
# * The length of `image` and `image[0]` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.
# * The given starting pixel will satisfy `0 <= sr < image.length` and `0 <= sc < image[0].length`.
# * The value of each color in `image[i][j]` and `newColor` will be an integer in `[0, 65535]`.
