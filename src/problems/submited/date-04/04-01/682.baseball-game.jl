# 
# You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game
# consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future
# rounds' scores.
# 
# At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a
# list of strings `ops`, where `ops[i]` is the `ith` operation you must apply to
# the record and is one of the following:
# 
#   1. An integer `x` \- Record a new score of `x`.
#   2. `"+"` \- Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.
#   3. `"D"` \- Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
#   4. `"C"` \- Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
# 
# Return _the sum of all the scores on the record_.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
#     Output: 30
#     Explanation:
#     "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
#     "2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
#     "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
#     "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
#     "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
#     The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
#     Output: 27
#     Explanation:
#     "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
#     "-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
#     "4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
#     "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].
#     "D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].
#     "9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].
#     "+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].
#     "+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].
#     The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: ops = ["1"]
#     Output: 1
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= ops.length <= 1000`
#   * `ops[i]` is `"C"`, `"D"`, `"+"`, or a string representing an integer in the range `[-3 * 104, 3 * 104]`.
#   * For operation `"+"`, there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
#   * For operations `"C"` and `"D"`, there will always be at least one previous score on the record.
#
