# 
# Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a
# cycle in it.
# 
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
# be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally,
# `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is
# connected to.  **Note that  `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.
# 
# Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return
# `false`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: head = [1], pos = -1
#     Output: false
#     Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
#   * `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
#   * `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.
# 
# 
# 
# **Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
